# To-Do Web App

Hi Everyone,

Welcome to my To-Do Web App project! In this project, I focused on building a web application for organizing notes and goals using React.js. This project primarily aimed at improving my React.js and CSS skills.

### Key Features
- **React.js:** The app is built using React.js, leveraging its component-based architecture.
- **CSS:** I paid special attention to enhancing my CSS skills, ensuring the app is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Drag & Drop:** Implementing drag & drop functionality was a significant part of the project, which greatly contributed to improving the overall user experience.

### Future Improvements
While the app is functional and useful for daily use, there is always room for improvement. Here are some areas I plan to enhance:
- Adding user authentication
- Implementing a backend for persistent data storage
- Enhancing the UI/UX design

I enjoyed working on this project and I hope you find it useful. Feel free to reach out with any feedback or suggestions!
